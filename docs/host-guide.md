# Host Guide

Adapted from the [Jupyter Host Guide](https://jupyterlab-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/host-guide.html):

Meetings should be...

- Positive and friendly
- Welcoming and open to people from diverse backgrounds
- Newcomers in particular should be welcomed and encouraged to
  chime in, discuss, participate, or to simply observe if that is their preference.

We encourage all our contributors to host a meeting, if they're interested.

## Host Responsibilities

The host should facilitate the flow of a meeting. That means:

- Remind people to sign in and add to the [weekly meeting notes/agenda](https://hackmd.io/Y7fBMQPSQ1C08SDGI-fwtg); paste the link to this document into the chat. It's OK to do this multiple times; new joiners don't see previous chat messages.
- Going through the agenda:
  - *Do time checks/pause + move on to hit all items when there are time concerns*
- Guiding discussion:
  - *Read chats aloud for participants + the recording*
- Maintaining order / Making sure everyone has a chance to speak:
  - *Interject when someone has their hand raised*
- Mention/link to the [Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html) and how everyone is bound to it (including the host)

Partner with another contributor (a meeting facilitator) to do the following:

- Log in as the “Project Jupyter” host account for meeting management perks (removing spammers, muting and recording, etc.). If you would like access to this account, request access from the [Jupyter Security Team](mailto:security@ipython.org).
- Add a new section to this document with today's date, a table of attendees who have signed in, and an agenda. Agenda items should include a person who will lead the discussion.
- Our meetings include an on-the-record and an off-the-record portion. Usually about 5 minutes into the hour, the host says that they're ready to start recording, and records "to the cloud". When all agenda items are finished, the host makes a last call, then ends the recording, then off-record topics can be discussed. Off-record topics typically include issue triage and release readiness.
- Remove unwelcome recording bots:
  - Per the Jupyter community page, participants
  should not record meetings on their own. The host should ask participants
  that look like AI recording bots:
    - To identify themselves and state whether they're recording
    - If they get no response from the account, the host should assume
      it's recording, and remove it from the meeting.

### Start the Meeting — Sample Script 

> Hello and welcome to our [full date] Jupyter Frontends call. I’m
> [host name] and I’ll be your host today.
> This is a place to for all contributors to connect with each other
> and the community about JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, frontends, and accessibility. A special welcome to all first time
> participants! We want all newcomers to feel
> welcome, we invite you to join in on discussions, introduce yourself,
> or add items to the agenda.
> 
> Please keep in mind that this call will be recorded and posted to YouTube for the community to view. This call is a part of the Jupyter community, therefore we follow the Jupyter Code of Conduct, which you can read about at jupyter.org/conduct .

Prepare to start the recording:

> Before we start the recording, does anyone have anything they'd like
> to say off the record? (Say "We will now begin recording/The recording has ended" before starting/stopping recording :)

### After the Meeting

*Congratulations &#x1F680; on a finished meeting. Pat yourself on the back. Contributions like yours help to make the Jupyter community better!*

A few post-meeting items for either the host or meeting-facilitator to complete:

- Finalize meeting minutes: Go back to the notes and make any needed additions, corrections and formatting needed in order to make the notes easy to understand by someone who did not participate in the meeting.
- Publish the minutes: Capture the day's meeting minutes and publish them as a comment on the GitHub issue on [frontends-team-compass](https://github.com/jupyterlab/frontends-team-compass/issues) linked in the agenda or pinned atop the issues list.
