# Host Guide (for Weekly Meetings)

Welcome to the Host Guide, a place for weekly call hosts to get help,
info, advice and best practices for conducting great, fun, effective
weekly meetings.

Check the [Suggested Meeting Script section](#meeting-script-and-checklist)
if you want a TL;DR for quick tips to follow for running a great meeting, and
peruse the other sections for basic info and additional context.

## &#x23F0; Basic Meeting Event Info

Jupyter Frontends team meetings are held every Wednesday. You can check the [Jupyter Community Meetings calendar](https://jupyter.org/community#calendar) for the exact time in your timezone.

Read the [weekly meeting notes/agenda here](https://hackmd.io/Y7fBMQPSQ1C08SDGI-fwtg).

## &#x1F3AF; Meeting Purpose/Goals

The weekly meetings are a way to connect JupyterLab contributors and the
community, so (ideally) all participants should have a good time, feel welcome,
and be heard. In line with that:

Meetings should be...

- Positive, friendly, exciting
- Welcoming and open to JupyterLab users from diverse backgrounds
- Newcomers in particular should be welcomed and encouraged to
  chime in and discuss, or participate in whatever way they would like

## &#x1F4AC; Topics

Weekly meetings are for contributors to discuss features, demos, ideas, PRs and
any other work on JupyterLab, and for the community to discuss their work, connect
with JupyterLab contributors, seek help, and more.

## &#x1F4AA; Host Responsibilities

First and foremost, the host should facilitate the flow of a meeting. That means:

- [ ] Going through the agenda:
  - *Do time checks/pause + move on to hit all items when there are time concerns*
- [ ] Guiding discussion:
  - *Read chats aloud for participants + the recording*
- [ ] Maintaining order / Making sure everyone has a chance to speak:
  - *Interject when someone has their hand raised*
- [ ] Mention/link to the Jupyter Code of Conduct and how everyone is bound to it

The host should also:

- [ ] Try to log in as the “Project Jupyter” host account for meeting management perks (kicking spammers, muting and recording, etc.), [request access](mailto:security@ipython.org) from the Jupyter Security Team.
- [ ] Record the meeting: The host starts and stops the recording. These are
  posted to YouTube for the community to view.
- [ ] Try to keep meeting minutes on [the collaborative HackMD document](https://hackmd.io/Y7fBMQPSQ1C08SDGI-fwtg)
- [ ] Provide a signal ("Brace yourselves") when starting/stopping recording
- [ ] Kick unwelcome recording bots:
  - Per the Jupyter community page, participants
  should not record meetings on their own. The host should ask participants
  that look like AI recording bots:
  - To identify themselves and state whether they're recording
  - If they get no response from the account, the host should assume
    it's recording, and remove it from the meeting.

Last, keep in mind that the code of conduct applies to hosts too! Hosts should
peruse and follow the Jupyter Code of conduct.

## &#x270f; Meeting Script and Checklist

### &#x23F3; Pre-Meeting Prep

- [ ] Log in to Zoom from the Project Jupyter account [(*request access*](mailto:security@ipython.org)
*from the Jupyter Security group if needed*)
- [ ] Make sure you have a stable internet
connection, a good quality microphone, and a quiet environment.
- [ ] Check the [meeting agenda on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/Y7fBMQPSQ1C08SDGI-fwtg)
  - *The agenda is a collaboratively created document made by the participants.*
    *Ensure a section for today's meeting is created, with today's date and a table*
    *for participants to record their names (which can be copied/pasted from lower*
    *entries). The agenda will also be used as meeting minutes.*

### &#x1F399; At the start of the meeting

```
Hello and welcome to our [day, month, year] Jupyter community call. I’m
[host name] and I’ll be your host today.

This is a place to for JupyterLab contributors to connect with each other
and the community about JupyterLab topics. We want all newcomers to feel
welcome, so please feel free to jump in on discussions, introduce yourself,
or add your own items to the agenda.

There’s a couple things to know while you are here.

First, I want to remind everyone that community calls will be recorded and
posted to YouTube for the community to view. Please keep that in mind while
you’re here.

Second, I’d like to remind people that as this is a part of the Jupyter
community we are all held to the Jupyter Code of Conduct. You can read about
the code of conduct at jupyter.org/conduct.

If you haven’t been here before, here’s how this works. Presenters have
submitted what they want to share ahead of time and can be found on the
agenda. We’ll have a little time for discussion with each one.
```

### &#x1F4DA; Starting the agenda

```
[Prepare to start the recording]

Okay, before we start the recording, does anyone have anything they'd like
to say off the record? (Say "Brace Yourselves!" before starting/stopping
recording :)

[After the recording ends]

If you have anything to say off the record, please feel free to discuss
that now.
```

### &#x1F3BA; Near the end of the call

```
Thank you to everyone presenting and attending! I’m happy to have you all as a part
of the Jupyter community.

If you have any feedback, please direct it at [platform/link]. I’d love to hear what
you think about the call.

Our next community call will be [day, month]. Check out the Jupyter community calendar
to see what other types of meetings
are happening in between.

If you have any interest in sharing in future community calls, please do! It doesn’t
have to be a big share, a polished share, or a technical share, just show off what
you do with Jupyter that excites you. Submit topics here [platform/link].

If you’re interested in hosting a community call, feel free to reach out. It would be
great to get different people interacting with the community.
```

### &#x1F389; After the Meeting

*Congratulations &#x1F680; on a finished meeting! Pat yourself on the back. We want to thank you SO MUCH for volunteering to make the Jupyter community better!*

There are just a few post-meeting TODO items:

- [ ] Finalize meeting minutes: Go back to HackMD and make any needed additions,
corrections and formatting you can.
- [ ] Publish the minutes: Convert the HackMD document to markdown and publish
it to the relevant Weekly Team Meetings archive issue on GitHub [(example)](https://github.com/jupyterlab/frontends-team-compass/issues/205)
in the Jupyter Frontends team-compass repository for the corresponding time period
(search issues, and look for the 6 month period the meeting belongs to).

&#x1F305; The Jupyter community depends on volunteers like you, so again we
would like to thank you for helping the Jupyter project bring free and open
tools for interactive computing to the world.
