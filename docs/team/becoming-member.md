# Becoming a JupyterLab Council member

This document describes how to become a council member. It includes information about the two subgroups of JupyterLab Council members:
- The release group (see [Release team member](#release-team-member))
- The admin group (see [Admin team member](#admin-team-member))

## JupyterLab Council member

### JupyterLab Council responsibilities

Members actively carry out the responsibilities listed in the [Membership Guide Page](membership_guidelines):

* Must be nominated by a current member.
* Can be elected as the Software Steering Council representative for JupyterLab.
* Get a vote in a voting situation.
* Count towards quorum in a voting situation.
* Are expected to participate in a 2/3 of votes (through a year).
* Can nominate new members.
* Should actively participate, either synchronously or asynchronously, in meetings.


### Nominating a new member

For someone to become a JupyterLab Council member, they should already be a consistent,
positive, productive member of the community. Newcomers are encouraged to
become members after they've shown a sustained interest in
engaging with the community. Moreover, council members should be interested in
**continuing their engagement** over a long-ish period of time (at least one year), generally
putting in more time and effort than non-members. This doesn't have to
mean contributing code - it can be assisting others in forums/issues, reviewing
pull requests, participating in team meetings, etc.

Any new members must be nominated and championed by an active JupyterLab Council member.
This process takes the following steps:

1. The champion should first discuss internally with the JupyterLab Council to
   ensure that there's general consensus before officially starting
   the process.
2. If there is obvious consensus within the JupyterLab Council, then move to the
   next step. If not, then an internal vote can be taken to protect the privacy
   of the potential member.
3. A member of the JupyterLab Council contacts the potential new member and asks
   if they are interested. Don't forget to run them by the {ref}`membership_guidelines`
   page to make sure they understand what they're signing up for.

### Membership maintenance

Every six months, a bot will open an issue in the [council repo](https://github.com/jupyterlab/council) asking all currently active JupyterLab council team members to reply within three weeks if they still consider themselves active. If a team member replies no, they will be removed from the council. If a member does not reply, the council may reach that member personally for membership confirmation. If that request for confirmation is not answered within a month, the member will be removed from the council.

## Release team member

### Joining the release team

Any JupyterLab Council member can ask to be part of the release team using the weekly call, chat, or official council email list.

> Private channel is recommended to limit the exposure of such information for security reason.

### Release team responsibilities

Release team members will be added to the following groups:

- GitHub JupyterLab organization: membership of the [release team](https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab/teams/release)
- PyPI Jupyter organization: manager of the [JupyterLab team](https://pypi.org/manage/organization/jupyter/team/jupyterlab)
- NPM jupyterlab organization: membership of the [jupyterlab team](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/jupyterlab/teams)
- conda-forge jupyterlab recipes: maintainer rights

> An admin will need to add a new member to all three teams and the conda recipes.

Members of the release team have publication rights for major JupyterLab-related packages through the PyPI and NPM teams. Team members can publish a release and can react quickly in case a published package is broken or corrupted.

### Release membership maintenance

Every six months, a bot will open an issue in the [council repo](https://github.com/jupyterlab/council) asking all current release team members to reply within three weeks if they still consider themselves active. If a member replies no, or they do not reply, we will conclude that they step down of the release team. Stepping down members may be removed from the publication groups on PyPI and NPM and the conda recipes maintainers.

## Admin team member

### Joining the admin team

Any JupyterLab Council member can ask to be part of the admin team using the weekly call, chat, or official council email list.

> Private channel is recommended to limit the exposure of such information for security reason.

There should be no more than seven administrators. If there are seven administrators already, consensus should be achieved between the new admin candidate and the existing administrators to determine a new seven-person admin team.

> The Software Steering Council representative will automatically be part of this group.
> The Executive Council will and must own at least one administrator seat. If the last executive council administrator resigns, the executive council must nominate a new administrator.

### Admin team responsibilities

Admin team members will be added to the following groups:

- GitHub JupyterLab organization: [owners](https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab)
- PyPI Jupyter organization: manager of the [JupyterLab team](https://pypi.org/manage/organization/jupyter/team/jupyterlab)
- NPM jupyterlab organization: [owners](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/jupyterlab)
- conda-forge jupyterlab recipe: maintainer rights

Administrators maintain membership of the groups listed above as well as the JupyterLab council and release team.

### Membership maintenance

Every six months, a bot will open an issue in the [council repo](https://github.com/jupyterlab/council) asking all current administrator team members to reply within three weeks if they still consider themselves active. If a member says no, or they do not respond, we will conclude that they step down. Stepping down member may be removed from the groups mentioned above.
