## Software Steering Council Representative

Each *official* subproject in Jupyter gets a single [Software Steering Council Representative](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_steering_council.html#software-steering-council). JupyterLab's representative is elected by the members. This representative *should* be re-elected every year (i.e. in January).

The current representative is Frédéric Collonval.
