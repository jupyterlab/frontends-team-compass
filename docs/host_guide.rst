Host Guide (for Weekly Meetings)
================================

Welcome to the Host Guide, a place for weekly call hosts to get help,
info, advice and best practices for conducting great, fun, effective
weekly meetings.

Check the Suggested Meeting Script section if you want a TL;DR for quick
tips to follow for running a great meeting, and peruse the other sections
for basic info and additional context.

Basic Meeting Event Info
------------------------

JupyterLab team meetings are held every Wednesday. You can check the Jupyter Community
Meetings calendar [LINK/TODO] for the exact time in your timezone.

HACKMD link/info here TODO.

Meeting Purpose/Goals
---------------------

The weekly meetings are a way to connect JupyterLab contributors and the
community, so (ideally) all participants should have a good time, feel welcome,
and be heard. In line with that:

Meetings should be...
- Positive, friendly, exciting
- Welcoming and open to JupterLab users from diverse backgrounds
- Newcomers in particular should be welcomed and encouraged to
  chime in and discuss, or participate in whatever way they would like

Topics
^^^^^^

Weekly meetings are for contributors to discuss features, demos, ideas, PRs and
any other work on JupyterLab, and for the community to discuss their work, connect
with JupyterLab contributors, seek help, and more.

Host Responsibilities
---------------------

First and foremost, the host should facilitate the flow of a meeting. That means:

- Going through the agenda
- Guiding discussion
- Making sure everyone has a chance to speak
- Maintaining order

The host should also:

- Try to log in as the “Project Jupyter” host account during meetings so they
can manage the meeting (kicking spammers, muting and recording, etc.), more
info about that HERE [LINK/TODO].
- Record the meeting. The host starts and stops the recording. These are
posted to YouTube for the community to view.
- Try to keep meeting minutes on the collaborative HackMD document [LINK/TODO]

Last, keep in mind that the code of conduct applies to hosts too!

Meeting Script and Checklist
----------------------------

Pre-Meeting Prep
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Log in to Zoom from the Project Jupyter account. Request access HERE [LINK/TODO]
if needed. Make sure you have a stable internet connection, a good quality
microphone, and a quiet environment. 

Check the meeting agenda on HackMD. The agenda is a collaboratively created
document made by the participants. Ensure a section for today's meeting is
created, with today's date and a table for participants to record their names
(which can be copied/pasted from lower entries). The agenda will also be used
as meeting minutes.

At the start of the meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hello and welcome to our [day, month, year] Jupyter community call. I’m
[host name] and I’ll be your host today.

This is a place to for JupyterLab contributors to connect with each other
and the community about JupyterLab topics. We want all newcomers to feel
welcome, so please feel free to jump in on discussions, introduce yourself,
or add your own items to the agenda.

There’s a couple things to know while you are here.

First, I want to remind everyone that community calls will be recorded and
posted to YouTube for the community to view. Please keep that in mind while
you’re here.

Second, I’d like to remind people that as this is a part of the Jupyter
community we are all held to the Jupyter Code of Conduct. You can read about 
the code of conduct at jupyter.org/conduct.

If you haven’t been here before, here’s how this works. Presenters have
submitted what they want to share ahead of time and can be found on the
agenda. We’ll have a little time for discussion with each one.

Starting the agenda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[Prepare to start the recording]
Okay, before we start the recording, does anyone have anything they'd like
to say off the record? (Say "Brace Yourselves!" before starting/stopping
recording :)

[After the recording ends]
If you have anything to say off the record, please feel free to discuss
that now.

Near the end of the call
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thank you to everyone presenting and attending! I’m happy to have you all as a part
of the Jupyter community.

If you have any feedback, please direct it at [platform/link]. I’d love to hear what
you think about the call.

Our next community call will be [day, month]. Check out the Jupyter community calendar
to see what other types of meetings 
are happening in between.

If you have any interest in sharing in future community calls, please do! It doesn’t
have to be a big share, a polished share, or a technical share, just show off what
you do with Jupyter that excites you. Submit topics here [platform/link].

If you’re interested in hosting a community call, feel free to reach out. It would be
great to get different people interacting with the community.

After the Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finalize meeting minutes: Go back to HackMD and make any needed additions,
corrections and formatting you can.

Publish the minutes: Convert the HackMD document to markdown and publish
it to the relevant Weekly Team Meetings thread on GitHub [LINK/TODO] in the
JupyterLab team-compass repository on the corresponding thread.
